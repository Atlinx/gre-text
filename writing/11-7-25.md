Governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are
unclear.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the
recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing
and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the
recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples
shape your position.

Pros
- >>> Prevents misuse of tax-payer funding
	- **Ex.** U.S. government has net deficit
	- Government funding could be purposefully misused by people claiming to be researcher 
- Government cannot always decide what area is likely to succeed
	- Certain innovations may depend on advancement from another field
		- **Ex.** DARPA briefly invested in the AI and neural networks back in the 1950s, but then investment tapered off as they hit limits of the current generation of hardware
			- Only after advancements in GPU processing power did neural networks finally become viable
Cons
- >> Research topics can be national security concerns
	- Studies of sociology can help diagnose issues affecting the American public 
	- Medical studies can help identify trends in diseases
- Research focus on discovery is an investment for the future
	- Exploratory vs. incremental research
	- Incremental research has clear goal
	- Research for purpose of discovery can lay foundation for future work
	- **Ex.** U.S. 
- >>> Research may take time to develop, and any form of assistance will help accelerate it
	- **Ex.** Progress by mRNA vaccine — while finally unlocked by researchers in a  pharmaceutical company — is built upon years of work done by many experts in the field. The Government had a role in funding parts of this research.

Government-funded scientific research should have clear implications, but its consequences do not have to be immediate, since exploratory research is a vital diagnostic tool and breakthroughs take time to develop.
