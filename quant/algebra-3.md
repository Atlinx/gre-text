Function
?
- Equation that takes in an input and produces an output
- GRE only cares about single-variate functions
- **Ex.** $f(x) = x^2 + 1$
	- Input is $x$
	- Output is the result of $x^2 + 1$ 

Recursive functions
?
- Steps to solve
	1. Start with the initial equation they give you
	2. Manipulate the equation based on the function's definition to get the next recursive iteration
	3. Repeat as many iterations as necessary to reach the desired value
		1. If you notice a pattern, you can try to skip ahead
- **Ex.**
	- $f(x)$ is a function such that $f(x + 1) = 10f(x)$. If $f(3) = 5$, what is the value of $f(6)$?
	- $f(3) = 5$
	- $f(3 + 1) = 10 f(3) = f(4) = 10 \cdot 5 = 50$
	- If you notice a pattern, you can try to skip ahead
		- $6 - 3 = 3$
		- $f(6) = 5 \cdot 10^3 = 5000$

Function with expression in input
?
- **Ex.** Function $f$ is defined by $f(3x + 2) = 2x^3 + 8$ What is $f(11)$?
	- You solve for the expression in the input first
		- $3x + 2 = 11$
		- $3x = 9$
		- $x = 3$
	- Then you plug in the $x$ value into the function
		- $f(3) = 2 \cdot 3^3 + 8 = 2 \cdot 27 + 8 = 54 + 8 = 62$
