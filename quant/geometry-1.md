Geometry line
?
- Straight lines that extend infinitely

Geometry line segment
?
- Portion of a straight line that has a fixed length

Congruence
?
- Two geometric objects that are the same
- **Ex.**
	- Congruent line segments -> Line segments of the same length

Angle
?
- Measurement of the "amount" of a rotation
- There are $360^\circ$ in a circle
- $180^\circ$ is half of a circle
- ![[Pasted image 20251104095618.png]]
- If two or more lines are intersecting at the same point, the sum of all angles around the point should be $180^\circ$

Opposite angles
?
- If two lines are intersecting, opposite angles have the same degree
- ![[Pasted image 20251104095628.png]]

Supplementary angles
?
- A line divides space into two halves of $180^\circ$
- Therefore all angles along one half should sum to $180^\circ$
- ![[Pasted image 20251104095606.png]]

Perpendicular (right) angles
?
- $90^\circ$ angles, which is formed by a line that is perfectly horizontal relative to another line
- ![[Pasted image 20251104095820.png]]
- If a line $A$ is $90^\circ$ to another line $B$, we say
	- $A$ is perpendicular to $B$
	- $A \perp B$

Acute angle
?
- Angles that are $0^\circ< x < 90^\circ$

Obtuse angle
?
- Angles that are $90^\circ < x < 180^\circ$

Straight angle
?
- Angle that is $180^\circ$

Complementary angles
?
- If a $90^\circ$ angle is divided by one or more lines, the sum of the individual angles should be $90^\circ$
- ![[Pasted image 20251104095835.png]]

Parallel lines
?
- Two lines that do not touch
- If two lines $A$ and $B$ are parallel to each other, we say
	- $A \parallel B$
- If two parallel lines intersect another line, then the opposite inner angles are equal
- ![[Pasted image 20251104100259.png]]

Polygon
?
- Closed figure with 3 or more line segments (sides)
- Circles are **NOT** a polygon because it doesn't have any sides
- Polygons are often defined by their vertices
	- **Ex.** Triangle $ABC$

Circle
?
- Curve drawn with a fixed radius around some center point
- Circles are **NOT** a polygon because it doesn't have any sides
	- You can think of circles as having "infinitely" many sides

Interior angle
?
- The angle between two lines on the inside edge of a polygon
- The sum of all interior angles $=(n - 2)180^\circ$
	- This formula comes from the fact that we can divide a shape into triangles
	- The number of triangles is always 2 less than the number of sides
	- ![[Pasted image 20251104101857.png]]
- The interior angle for each corner of a regular polygon is just the total divided by $n$
	- $$\huge \displaystyle\frac{(n-2)180^\circ}{n}$$
	- As the number of sides increases, the interior angle approaches but never reaches $180^\circ$
- ![[Pasted image 20251104101157.png]]
- 

Exterior angle
- If we extend the line segments of the polygon, the exterior angle is the other half of the interior angle on the outside
- The sum of all exterior angles $= 360^\circ$
	- This value can be derived from the definition of a $360^\circ$, which is a full rotation, which is the angle of a circle
	- ![[Pasted image 20251104102600.png]]
- - The exterior angle for each corner of a regular polygon is just the total divided by $n$
	- $$\huge \displaystyle\frac{360^\circ}{n}$$
	- As the number of sides increases, the angle approaches but never reaches $0^\circ$
- ![[Pasted image 20251104101157.png]]

Regular polygon
?
- Polygon which all sides are equal and all 

Perimeter
?
- Sum of lengths of sides of a polygon

Area
?
- Total 2D space take up by a shape

Triangle
?
- 3-sided polygon
- Sum of interior angles is $180^\circ$
- If you extend one of the edges, the outer angle is equal to the sum of the opposite inner angles of the triangle 
	- This is because
		- $\text{a}_{\text{outer}} + c =180^\circ$
		- $a + b + c = 180^\circ$
		- Therefore
			- $a_{\text{outer}} = a + b$

Pentagon
?
- 5-sided polygon

Hexagon
?
- 6-sided polygon

Heptagon
?
- 7-sided polygon

Octagon
?
- 8-sided polygon

Nonagon
?
- 9-sided polygon

Decagon
?
- 10-sided polygon

Types of triangles
?
- Equilateral triangle
	- All sides have equal length
	- All interior angles are $60^\circ$
- Right triangle
	- One interior angle is a right angle ($90^\circ$)
- Isosceles
	- Two corners have the same interior angle
	- Two sides have equal length
	- It's possible for an isosceles triangle to also be a right triangle
		- In this case, the identical angles are each $45^\circ$
	- ![[Pasted image 20251104102910.png]]

Opposite sides and angles
?
- Look at the opposite side lengths to determine the relative scales of the angles
- **NOTE:** Opposite side lengths are **NOT** proportional to angles
	- **Ex.** $a^\circ:b^\circ \neq 10:7$ 
- ![[Pasted image 20251104103038.png]]

Possible side lengths of a triangle
?
- Sum of any two sides must be greater than the third
- Given a triangle with sides $a, b, c$
	- $a + b > c$
	- Imagine what happens if $a + b = c$
		- We are left with just a straight line, therefore the smallest triangle must have $a + b > c$
- We can use this formula to create a system of inequalities and find the range of possible side lengths for a triangle
	- ![[Pasted image 20251104103605.png]]

Area of rectangle
?
- $$\huge lh$$
	- $l =$ length of rectangle
	- $h =$ height of rectangle (length of neighboring side)

Area of triangle
?
- $$\huge \frac{1}{2} bh$$
	- $b =$ length of base of triangle
	- $h =$ height of triangle
		- Height is measured perpendicular from the base of the triangle to the opposite vertex
- Triangles can have the same area but look very different
	- ![[Pasted image 20251104103807.png]]

When are triangles congruent?
?
- Triangles are congruent (when everything is equal) when
	- SSS = side-side-side
	- SAS = side-angle-side
	- ASA = angle-side-angle
	- AAS =angle-angle-side
- ![[Pasted image 20251104103943.png]]
- Undeterminable
	- AAA = angle-angle-angle
		- The triangle may be scaled up or down, which leads to different side angles
	- ASS = angle-side-side
		- You can rotate the second side to form a different triangle with different angles and sides
		- ![[Pasted image 20251104104153.png]]

Hypotenuse
?
- Diagonal side of a right triangle

Pythagorean theorem
?
- Given a right triangle with sides $a, b$, and hypotenuse $c$ 
	- $$\huge a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
- ![[Pasted image 20251104104334.png]]
- Formula can be understood geometrically as finding the area of the squares that are touching 
	- ![[Pasted image 20251104104425.png]]

Pythagorean triplets
?
- Set of 3 **integers** that follow the Pythagorean theorem
	- $3, 4, 5$
	- $5, 12, 13$
	- $8, 15, 17$
	- $7, 24, 25$
- Pythagorean triplets are infinite
	- Select two positive integers $m, n$ where $n > m$
		- Side 1 $= 2nm$
		- Side 2 $=n^2 - m^2$
		- Hypotenuse $= m^2 + n^2$

30-60-90 triangles
?
- If we have a right triangle with angles $30^\circ, 60^\circ, 90^\circ$
- $30^\circ$ leg = $x$
- $60^\circ$ leg = $\sqrt{ 3 } x$
- $90^\circ$ leg = $2x$
