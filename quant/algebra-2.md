Solving absolute value equations
?
- Given an absolute value equation, move the absolute value to the LHS and create a negative and positive RHS case
- **Ex.**
	- $|x|=5$
		- $x=-5$
		- $x=5$

Possible outcomes of solving system of equations
?
- Fixed set of solutions
	- There is a fixed set of solutions for the variables
- Infinitely many solutions
	- One or more variables may take on an infinite number of potential values
	- Number of unique equations (not equivalent equations) < Number of variables
- Contradiction (impossible)
	- The system of equations has a contradiction

Quadratic equations
?
- Solve $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
- Either have
	- One solution
	- Two solutions
	- Zero solutions
- Methods
	- Factor the trinomial
		- **Ex.** $3x^2 -7x - 6 = (3x + 2)(x - 3) = 0$
			- $3x + 2 = 0$
				- $x = -\dfrac{2}{3}$
			- $x - 3 = 0$
				- $x = 3$
	- Use the quadratic formula
		- $$\large \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{ b^2 - 4ac }}{2a}$$
		- If root portion is negative, then that solution is not valid

Discriminant (quadratic formula)
?
- Portion inside quadratic formula that determines how many solutions there are
- $$\large b^2 - 4ac$$
- Positive → 2 solutions
- Zero → 1 solution
- Negative → 0 solutions

Completing the square
?
- We know that $x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = (x + a)^2$
- Therefore we can rewrite a regular term into a form that can be factored
- **Ex.** 
	- $$\begin{align}
		y &= x^2 + 6x + 10 \\
		&= x^2 + 6x + 9 + 1 \\
		&= (x + 3)^2 + 1
		\end{align}$$
	- If $x=-3$, then we know the smallest possible $y$ value is 1

Inequality
?
- Equation that has a $<$ $\leq$ $\geq$ or $>$ sign
- **Ex.** $x \geq 1$
- If we multiply by a negative number, the inequality flips
	- **Ex.** 
		- $x \geq 1$
		- multiply by $-1$
		- $-x \leq -1$
	- **Ex.**
		- $x > 1$
		- multiply by $-1$
		- $-x < -1$
- For single-variable inequalities, you can plot solutions as points on a number line
	- Draw a closed circle on points that are inclusive
	- Draw an open circle on points that are exclusive
	- Test the location between points to see if the area between the points is a valid solution
		- You can use the multiplicity of the factors to quickly label the regions after testing a single region
		- If the multiplicity (exponent of) a factor is odd, then the validity flips across that point's neighboring regions
		- If the multiplicity (exponent of) a factor is even, then the validity stays that same across the point's neighboring regions
- For two-variable inequalities, you can shade in areas above or below a line on a coordinate plane

Absolute value inequality
?
- Make sure to flip the inequality sign for the negative variant
- **Ex.** $|x + 3| < 8$
	- $x + 3 < 8$
	- $x + 3 > -8$
