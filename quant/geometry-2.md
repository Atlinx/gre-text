45-45-90 triangle
?
- Triangle with angles $45^\circ, 45^\circ, 90^\circ$
	- This is a right triangle and isosceles triangle
- Side of two $45^\circ$ is $x$
- Hypotenuse is $x\sqrt{ 2 }$

Use 45-45-90 and 30-60-90 triangles
?
- Some problems may require you to break a larger triangle into 45-45-90 and 30-60-90 triangles that you can then find the side lengths for

Area of equilateral triangle
?
- $$\huge \text{area}=\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{4}x^2$$
	- $x =$ side length of the equilateral triangle
- This can also be interpreted as 
	- $$\huge \text{area} = \sqrt{ 3 } \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^2$$
	- We are taking the side length, dividing it by half, then multiplying it with itself and $\sqrt{ 3 }$
	- "half half $\sqrt{ 3 }$"
- This formula is derived from bisecting the triangle in half, and then use 30-60-90 triangle rules to find the height of the original triangle

Similar triangles
?
- Triangles that have the same angles, but may be of different scales
	- Congruent triangles are similar to each other
- If two triangles have the same 2 angles, then they are similar
- Two similar triangles have a scaling factor $s$ that converts from one triangle to the other
	- $l_{a} = s l_{b}$
		- $l =$ side length
	- $a_{a} = s^2 a_{b}$
		- $a =$ area
- The side-length proportions of two similar triangles are the same
	- ![[Pasted image 20251104121851.png]]
	- **Ex.**
		- Given similar triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$
		- $\displaystyle \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF}$
- Similar triangles can also show up inside of right triangles, isosceles triangles, etc.

Quadrilateral
?
- 4-sided polygon
- Types
	- Trapezoid
		- Parallelogram
			- Rectangle 
				- Square 
			- Rhombus

Square
?
- 4-sided polygon
	- Each side is perpendicular to its neighbors
	- Sides have equal length
- Squares are rectangles
- Squares are quadrilaterals
 
Rectangle
?
- 4-sided polygons
	- Each side is perpendicular to its neighbors
	- Opposite sides are parallel
	- Opposite sides have equal length
- Rectangles are quadrilaterals

Parallelogram
?
- 4-sided polygon
	- Opposite sides are parallel to each other
	- Opposite sides have equal length
- Are quadrilaterals
- Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect the shape

Bisect
?
- To split a shape into two equal parts
- To split a shape into two congruent parts

Rhombus
?
- A parallelogram, where all sides have the same length

Trapezoid
?
- 4-sided polygon
	- At least one pair of parallel sides


Area of rectangle
?
- $$\huge \text{area} = w \cdot h$$
	- $w =$ width of rectangle
	- $h =$ height of rectangle
- Area is measured in $\text{unit}^2$, because we measure area using $1 \times 1$ squares

Area of parallelogram
?
- $$\huge \text{area} = b \cdot h$$
	- $b =$ base of parallelogram
	- $h =$ height of parallelogram, from base to the top
		- Do **NOT** use the slanted sides!

Area of trapezoid
?
- $$\huge \text{area} = \frac{1}{2} (b_{1} + b_{2}) h$$
	- $b_{1} =$ one of the parallel segments' length
	- $b_{2} =$ the other parallel segment length
	- $h$ = height of the trapezoid
		- Perpendicular length between parallel bases
	- This formula is actually the foundation for triangle and all parallelograms

Area of regular hexagon
?
- $$\huge \text{area} = 6 \cdot \left( \frac{s}{2} \right)^2 \sqrt{ 3 }$$
	- $s =$ side length of the hexagon
- This is derived from the fact that hexagons are made up of 6 equilateral triangles
	- Recall equilateral triangles are also isosceles triangles, and the area for isosceles triangle is
		- $\displaystyle \left( \frac{s}{2} \right)^2 \sqrt{ 3 }$

Apothem
?
- Line from center of polygon to the middle of a side

Area of regular polygon
?
- $$\huge \text{area} = \frac{1}{2} asn$$
	- $n =$ number of sides
	- $a =$ apothem (line from center of polygon to middle of a side)
	- $s =$ side length of the polygon
- This might not be on the GRE, since you'd need trigonometry

Maximizing polygon's area
?
- How can we maximize an n-polygon's area given a fixed perimeter?
	- Use a **regular** polygon
- How can we maximize the area if we can use any shape?
	- Use a **circle**

Circumference
?
- $$\huge \text{circumference} = 2\pi r = \pi d$$
	- $r =$ radius of circle
	- $d =$ diameter of circle
- Distance of going around the circle
- The "perimeter" of the circle
- ![[Pasted image 20251104143654.png]]

Center (circle)
?
- Point where the circle is drawn around
- Every line from center to outside point in the circle has the same distance
- ![[Pasted image 20251104143654.png]]

Radius
?
- Distance from center of circle to edge of the circle
- ![[Pasted image 20251104143654.png]]

Diameter
?
- $$\huge d = 2r$$
- Line that connects two points in the circle and the center.
- Length is twice the radius
- ![[Pasted image 20251104143705.png]]

Arc
?
- A fixed segment along the circumference
- Minor arc $\to$ Smaller arc
- Major arc $\to$ larger arc
- ![[Pasted image 20251104143707.png]]

Inscribed angle
?
- Angle measured from a point on the circumference
- ![[Pasted image 20251104143741.png]]

Central angle
?
- Angle from center to the outside of a circle
- ![[Pasted image 20251104143741.png]]

Sector
?
- "Piece" of the circle cut out from the center to the edge
- ![[Pasted image 20251104143741.png]]

$\huge \pi$
?
- Defined as $\dfrac{\text{circumference}}{\text{diameter}}$
- Commonly approximated as $3.14$ or $\dfrac{22}{7}$

Central angle theorem
?
- Central angle of any arc is double the angle of any inscribed angle that shares the same end-points
	- Notice how it creates 4 line segments
- $$\huge a_{\text{central}} = 2a_{\text{inscribed}}$$
- ![[Pasted image 20251104144546.png]]
- This does not work if don't have 4 line segments
	- ![[Pasted image 20251104144836.png]]
	- **Ex.** In the image above, we've created 5 line segments

Arc length
? ^arc-length
- $$\huge \text{arc length} = 2\pi r \cdot \frac{a^\circ}{360^\circ}$$
	- $a =$ central angle
	- $r =$ radius of circle
- Imagine this as taking the circumference and multiplying by the proportion of the central angle to the full circle's angle ($360^\circ$)
- If you want to find the major arc length, you can take the $\text{circumference} - \text{minor arc length}$ to find the major arc length
