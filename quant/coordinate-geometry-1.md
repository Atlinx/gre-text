xy-coordinate plane
?
- Defines a surface to plot points
- Defined by two lines that are perpendicular to each other
- Axis
	- One of the two lines on the plane
	- x-axis -> horizontal axis
	- y-axis -> vertical axis

Parabola
?
- U-shaped graph with the form
	- $y=x^2$

Line segment
?
- Portion of a line drawn on the coordinate plane
- Starts at one point and ends at another

Line
?
- Straight line with the equation
	- $y = mx + b$
- Extends forever in both directions

Origin
?
- Center of the xy-coordinate plane (0, 0)

Point $(x, y)$
?
- Point on the coordinate plane, defined by an $x$ and $y$ component

Circle equation
?
- $$\huge (x - x_{0})^2 + (y - y_{0})^2 = r^2$$
	- $(x_{0}, y_{0}) =$ center of circle
	- $r =$ radius of circle
	- It's very important that we're adding $x^2$ to $y^2$
		- Otherwise, it's not a circle

Parabola vertex form
?
- $$\huge y - y_{0} = a(x - x_{0})^2$$
	- $(x_{0}, y_{0}) =$ center of parabola (tip of the U shape)
	- $a =$ scaling factor

Hyperbola
?
- $$\huge y=\frac{1}{x}$$
	- Diagonal hyperbola
- $$\huge \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$
	- Left right hyperbola
- $$\huge \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$
	- Up down hyperbola
- $$

Parabola standard form
?
- $$\huge y = ax^2 + bx + c$$
	- $c =$ y-intercept

y-intercept
?
- Point that a line intercepts with the y-axis
- Occurs when $x=0$ in the line equation

x-intercept
?
- Point that a line intercepts with the x-axis
- Occurs when $y = 0$ on the line equation

Quadrants
?
- Four sections of the xy-coordinate plane
- Starts from top right, and goes in counterclock-wise order
	- I $\to (x,y)$
	- II $\to (-x,y)$
	- III $\to(-x, -y)$
	- IV $\to (x, -y)$
- Any points on the line are not located in any quadrant, since they're on the edge of two or more quadrants

Vertical line
?
- $x = k$
- Has an undefined slope (according to GRE)

Horizontal line
?
- $y = k$
- Has a slope = 0

Reflecting over common lines
?
- Reflecting a point over x-axis
	- $(x, y) \to (x, -y)$
- Reflecting a point over y-axis
	- $(x, y) \to (-x, y)$
- Reflecting a point over $y=k$ (vertical line)
	- $(x, y) \to (x, 2k - y)$
- Reflecting a point over $x=k$ (horizontal line)
	- $(x, y) \to (2k - x, y)$
- Reflecting diagonally from quadrant II to IV ($y = x$)
	- $(x, y) \to (y, x)$
- Reflecting diagonally from quadrant I to III ($y = -x$)
	- AKA Reflecting about the origin
	- $(x, y) \to (-y, -x)$

y-intercept form
?
- Equation for a line
- $$\huge y = m(x - x_{0}) + b$$
	- $m=$ slop
	- $b$ = y-intercept

Point-slope form
?
- Equation for a line
- $$\huge y - y_{0} = m(x - x_{0})$$
	- $(x_{0}, y_{0}) =$ point that lies on this line
	- $m =$ slope

Special property of $y = x$
?
- All points above the line have $y > x$
- All points below the line have $x > y$
- On the line is $x = y$

Slope
?
- $$\huge s = \frac{y_{1} - y_{0}}{x_{1} - x_{0}}$$
	- Slope is how much the $y$ value of a line changes given some change in $x$
- Slope of $y = k$ (horizontal line) = 0
- Slope of $x = k$ (vertical line) = undefined (according to GRE)

Distance between two points
?
- $$\huge \text{dist} = \sqrt{ (x_{1} - x_{0})^2 + (y_{1} - y_{0})^2 }$$
- Given two points $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ and $(x_{1}, y_{1})$

Finding a perpendicular line
?
- Make a new line with the the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line
- **Ex.** $y = \dfrac{3}{5}$
	- Perpendicular line: $y = -\dfrac{5}{3}x$
