Make deductions
?
- It's important to make 

Choosing numbers
?
- Sometimes it's better to plug in numbers and build a table
- Choose a diverse amount of cases (positive, negative, zero, etc.)
- Numbers to choose
	- Integers
		- $2, -1, 0, 1, 2$
		- $0$ is a good number to choose for exponents or multiplication, because it has the chance of making $a^n = a^0 = 1$
	- Fractions
		- $\displaystyle -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}$
	- Numbers that have a lot of factors (easier to plug in)
		- $12, 24, 60, 120$
	- Powers of 2
		- $2^n = 4, 8, 16, 32$
		- Easy to divide in half
	- Tens
		- $10, 20, 40, 100$
		- Easy to plug in and simplify
- When do you stop choosing?
	- Choose more extreme numbers (very large number and a fraction)   

Counter-example
?
- In a quantitative comparison questions, if you can find two unique cases of $<, =, >$, then the answer is indeterminant
- Sometimes it's easier to try the $=$ version first if they give a number for $B$ and an expression for $A$, since that usually works
	- Then, try a version that is $\neq$

Percentage deduction
?
- In some problems, the total must be a whole number, because it's measuring something that is not divisible
	- **Ex.** People
- **Ex.** 37% of people in the room have brown hair
	- We know total number of people must be a whole number
	- $\displaystyle x \cdot 0.37 = \text{integer}$
	- Therefore, $x$ must be a multiple of $100$
	- It must divide evenly
	- Give a whole percentage 37%

Weighing blocks
?
- **Ex.** Given 16 blocks, one block is lighter than the other equally-weighed 15
	- Split blocks into group of 3
		- Weight 2 groups against each other
		- If one group is lighter
			- Continuing searching down that group
		- If both groups are equal weight, then the lighter block is in the third group
			- Continuing searching down that group
	- All weighing
		- $16 = 5 + 5 + 6$
		- $6 = 2 + 2 + 2$
		- $2 = 1 + 1$
	- In total, there are 3 weighing 

Backsolving
?
- Plug in answers into the equation and see if they work
- Use this method if it's easy to plug in answers, or if you don't know how to solve the problem in any other way

Piece-by-piece strategy
?
- Break large complex problems down into simpler problems to then solve

Simplifying QC answer choices
?
- Given a quantitative comparison question (comparing two quantities A and B)
- Try to make the two quantities look like each other
	- **Ex.** Given $x^2$ and $\dfrac{x^4}{x^2}$
	- Simplify $\dfrac{x^4}{x^2}$ to $x^2$
- Make sure to keep track of variables like $x$ in the denominator, since it may $= 0$
- Possible operations
	- Raise both sides to $\dfrac{1}{x}$ to cancel out a power
- Also if you divide by a variable, be wary of the case where the variable can $= 0$
-  If you simplify the two answer choices and end up with
	- $y = x$ where you don't know $y$ or $x$, then the answer is "cannot be determined"

Pattern recognition
?
-  Recognizing a pattern in $n_{1}, n_{2}, \dots$, then then using the information to help solve a problem
