Parallel lines
?
- Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope
- If two equations turn out to simplify to the same line, the two lines are not considered parallel because they are lying on top of each other

Finding a perpendicular line
?
- Make a new line with the the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line
- **Ex.** $y = \dfrac{3}{5}$
	- Perpendicular line: $y = -\dfrac{5}{3}x$

System of equations on plane
?
- No solution
	- Curves are parallel and do not intersect
- One solution
	- Curves intersect at one point
- $n$ solutions
	- Curves intersect at $n$ points
- Unlimited solutions
	- Two curves are identical and lie on top of each other

Inequalities on plane
?
- Inequalities are plotted as lines and a shaded area either above or below the line
- If we have $y \geq x$ or $y > x$, then shaded area is above the line
- If we have $y \leq x$ or $y < x$, then shaded area is below the line
- If we are exclusive ($>$ or $<$), then the line is dotted to indicate we're not including points on the line as valid solutions
- If we have a horizontal or vertical line, shade like how you would on a normal number line

System of inequalities on plane
?
- Plot out the inequality regions
- One solution
	- Regions intersect at one point
- Infinite solutions
	- Region overlapped by all the inequalities defines the set of valid solutions
- Zero solutions
	- Regions do not overlap (point away from each other)

Parabola vertex form
? ^parabola-vertex-form
- $$\huge y - y_{0} = a(x - x_{0})^2$$
	- $(x_{0}, y_{0}) =$ center of parabola (tip of the U shape)
	- $a =$ scaling factor
		- Positive means $\cup$ shape
		- Negative means $\cap$ shape
		- $0 < a < 1$
			- Scales down the parabola (flattens)
		- $1 < a$
			- Scales up the parabola (stretches)

Parabola standard form
?
- $$\huge y = ax^2 + bx + c$$
	- $c =$ y-intercept

Parabola y-intercept form
?
- $$\huge y = a(x - x_{0})^2 + y_{0}$$
	- $(x_{0}, y_{0}) =$ center of parabola (tip of the U shape)
	- $a =$ scaling factor
		- Positive means $\cup$ shape
		- Negative means $\cap$ shape
